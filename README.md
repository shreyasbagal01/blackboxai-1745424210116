# E-Vitaran Portal

## Project Overview
E-Vitaran is a web application designed to streamline bill management and payment processing for users. It integrates a user-friendly front end built with React.js and a robust back end with Node.js, offering features like user authentication, bill calculation, payment integration with Razorpay, and transaction history tracking.

## Installation

To get started with the E-Vitaran portal, you'll need to follow the setup instructions for both the backend and frontend components of the project.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- MongoDB (local setup or MongoDB Atlas)
- A valid Razorpay account for payment integration

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd e-vitaran
```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your MongoDB connection in the config files.
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000` (frontend). The backend API will typically run at `http://localhost:5000` (or whatever port you have configured).

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and login functionality.
- **Monthly Consumption Calculator**: Provides users a way to estimate their estimated bill.
- **Bill Generation**: Automatic bill generation based on user consumption.
- **Razorpay Payment Integration**: Seamless payment processing.
- **Transaction History**: Displays a history of previous transactions.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can manage their personal information.

The project utilizes several key libraries and frameworks, as defined in `package.json`:

### Backend Dependencies
- `express`: Web framework for Node.js
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool
- Other packages and middleware necessary for the backend functionality

### Frontend Dependencies
- `react`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- `@mui/material`: React components for faster and easier web development
- `react-router-dom`: Routing library for React
